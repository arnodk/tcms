Web 1.0, still here.

I have to admit, I do not like the social media outlets of today. But, to be entirely digitally introvert is not a
viable solution either, these days. So, I took to that old trusty format, the personal homepage. It might very well be Web 1.0,
but like the florescent green Hercules monitors way-back-when, it has a certain appeal. Last time I really sat down and tried to make something like this
we were partying like it was 1999, because it literally was.

I can only guess why you are here. Probably, a google search went horribly, horribly wrong. But, if you are actually here due
to genuine interest in whatever I am up to, you should find here the latest projects I am working on, and the stuff that I tend to be interested in.

On a side note, yes, this site is lacking any kind of design. Which, ironically, is by design. Those graphically heavy portfolio
sites are not really my thing. Every time I go to [link:https\://docs.docker.com/]Docker's documentation[/link] or the [link:https\://developer.mozilla.org/en/]MDN docs[/link], I can't help but to think that
those clean setups are exactly how websites should look like...
